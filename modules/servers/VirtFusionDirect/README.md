# VirtFusion Direct Provisioning Module for WHMCS

This module requires VirtFusion v1.7.3 or higher as this is what it's based on. Please refer to the official [documenataion](https://docs.virtfusion.com/integrations/whmcs).

## Changes in this module

- Allows using the configurable options quantity method for assigning Memory in Gigabytes instead of Megabyte. So you can use whole numbers to represent GB instead.
For example, prior to this change for two gigabytes of RAM you'd need to set 2048 as either the min or max amount, now you can just input 2 for 2GB.
